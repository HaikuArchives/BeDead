Notes:

This application is a handy little program killer.  It brings up a list of all the programs currently
running, and by double-clicking on any of them, you kill them.  No passing Go, no collecting 200$,
no asking you if you want to save your work.  Dead, deceased, disassembled, stiff, curled up
its tootsies, shuffled off this mortal coil, run down the curtain and joined the bleeding choir
invisible!  Bereft of life it rests in peace.  He fucking snuffed it!  Vis-a-Vis, the
metabolic processes, he's had his lot!  This is an Ex-program!

Ahem, Excuse me.  This is mostly useful as a programming utility... I use it when I write a program
that hangs / does nasty stuff.  My original intent was to write a program analogous to X-Kill, where
the user clicks on any window, and it ends that task.  Well, I couldn't figure out how to do that.
That's my next project, and mind you, it'll be a real beaut... none of your blood spattered on the
walls, flesh flying out of the windows incommoding the passers-by with this one.

If you're dumb enough to kill an application before saving your VALUABLE data, then you deserve
it, so I'm not going to warn you.

Oo, and if you uncheck the box "Close on Kill" then you can kill as many programs as you want....


Love,
John

ps: isn't Be cool?
